## The week of conference

(The first invited talk - the quality of real-time streaming was pretty bad, the quality of replay was good.

One needs to attend real-time if one wants to ask questions oneself; otherwise a more sedate approach might be better.

The second invited talk - the quality is fine now. Oral 1: AI Applications track - problems with real-time streaming again.

It was pretty bad on replay on Friday night; so it looks like this depends on the demand on their servers.)

## Post-conference

A conference of this size cannot be fully handled in real time (the day of workshops is particularly tricky).

Fortunately, the materials remain up and available after the conference with a registration pass. So there will be time for
post-processing all this and adding further notes.
